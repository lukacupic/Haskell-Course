  Welcome to your twelfth Haskell training.

  You should know the drill by now - solve the exercises in `TrainingExercises.hs`,
  run the tests with Cabal, push to `training-10`, create a Merge Request,
  and assign it to your TA.

  Keep in mind that **all exposed functions and instance definitions must have
  type signatures**.
  (helper functions that are defined in local definitions don't)!

  Also there aren't any extra tasks - all tasks are mandatory.

  Don't worry about the performance of your code.

  As always, ask your TA if you need any help.

{- * 12.1 Monads 1  -}

-- ** TE 12.1.1

-- Write two functions that extract information of how many kilograms of fruit the farmer with a certain ID produced.
-- Implement the function te1211 without using monads and te1211m using monads.
-- Feel free to write helper functions if necessary.
-- ex te1211 "9567" -> 1900

-- **** I hope you could see from this example how much cleaner the code is with monads. ****


-- ** TE 12.1.2

-- First, write a function which gets a fruit as input and returns a list of ID numbers of all the farmers which produced that fruit.
-- Then, write a function which gets the name of the fruit from console and prints out that list.
-- Inputs will always be one of defined fruits. (Tangerine, Kiwi, Strawberry) 
-- Use monads whenever possible. Skip farmers that dont have an ID number.
-- ex te1212 "Strawberry" -> ["4284","9567"] or ["9567","4284"] (order is unimportant)

-- ** TE 12.2.3

-- Write a function (using functions add3 and multiplyBy2) which takes an Int

--  multiplyBy2
--  add3
--  get

-- As you can see here we are just listing all computations that need to be done.


-- ** TE 12.2.5

-- Write a function (using list monads) that takes a list of Int and returns a list
-- with each odd element repeated three times.
