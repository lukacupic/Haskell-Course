# PUH Training: TE10 - Christmas Edition

Welcome to your tenth Haskell training.

## Exercises

You should know the drill by now - solve the exercises in `TrainingExercises.hs`,
run the tests with Cabal, push to `training-09`, create a Merge Request,
and assign it to your TA.

Keep in mind that **all exposed functions must have type signatures**
(helper functions that are defined in local definitions don't)!
Do not rename the functions.

When defining class type instances, replace the `TODO instance...` with your
definition.

There aren't any extra tasks - **all tasks are mandatory**.

Don't worry about the performance of your code.

As always, ask your TA if you need any help.

# Happy holidays!
