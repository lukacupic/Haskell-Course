  Welcome to your tenth Haskell training.

  You should know the drill by now - solve the exercises in `TrainingExercises.hs`,
  run the tests with Cabal, push to `training-10`, create a Merge Request,
  and assign it to your TA.

  Keep in mind that **all exposed functions and instance definitions must have
  type signatures**.
  (helper functions that are defined in local definitions don't)!

  When defining class type instances, replace the `TODO instance...` with your
  definition.

  Also there aren't any extra tasks - all tasks are mandatory.

  Don't worry about the performance of your code.

  As always, ask your TA if you need any help.

  Happy holidays!

{- * 10.1 Recursive data types and type class instances  -}

-- ** TE 10.1.1

-- Take a look at the definition of MyList data type from the lecture:
data MyList a = Empty | Cons a (MyList a) deriving Show

-- Define an 'Eq' instance for the MyList type so that two lists are considered
-- equal if they have the same elements regardless of their order.
-- Hint: think about a helper function that could help you here.

myListToList :: MyList a -> [a]
myListToList Empty       = []
myListToList (Cons x xs) = x : (myListToList xs)

instance (Eq a, Ord a) => Eq (MyList a) where
    l1 == l2 = sort (myListToList l1) == sort (myListToList l2)

-- ** TE 10.1.2

-- Take a look at the Christmas Tree data type - it's your normal tree, except
-- that it's got a new skin so the leafs have ornaments, and nodes have lights.
data ChristmasTree a = Ornament
            | Light { value :: a,
                    left  :: ChristmasTree a,
                    right :: ChristmasTree a }
  deriving Show

-- Define a function that takes a Christmas tree and returns a list containing
-- all elements in their in-order traversal.

treeToList :: ChristmasTree a -> [a]
treeToList Ornament             = []
treeToList (Light l left right) = (treeToList left) ++ [l] ++ (treeToList right)

-- ** TE 10.1.3
-- Let's say that two trees are equal if they contain the same elements
-- regardless of their order. Define an 'Eq' instance for the ChristmasTree type
-- that implements that notion of equality.

instance (Eq a, Ord a) => Eq (ChristmasTree a) where
    l1 == l2 = sort (treeToList l1) == sort (treeToList l2)
