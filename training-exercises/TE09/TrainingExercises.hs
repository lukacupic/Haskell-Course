  Welcome to your ninth Haskell training.

  You should know the drill by now - solve the exercises in `TrainingExercises.hs`,
  run the tests with Cabal, push to `training-09`, create a Merge Request,
  and assign it to your TA.

  Keep in mind that **all exposed functions must have type signatures**
  (helper functions that are defined in local definitions don't)!

  Also there aren't any extra tasks - all tasks are mandatory.

  As always, ask your TA if you need any help.

{- * 9.1 Parametrized Types  -}

-- ** TE 9.1.1
--
-- | Define a new parameterised data type `Pair` that has 2 parameters, a and b.
-- The data type should contain a single type constructor named Pair.
--
-- Make sure to derive `Show` and `Eq`.
--
data Pair a b = Pair a b deriving (Show, Eq)

-- ** TE 9.1.2
--
-- | Define a function which takes a Pair and returns its first element.
--
-- -> Example: Pair 1 'a' ==> 1

te912 :: Pair a b -> a
te912 (Pair a _) = a

-- ** TE 9.1.3
--
-- | Define a function which takes a Pair and returns its second element.
--
-- -> Example: Pair 1 'a' ==> 'a'

te913 :: Pair a b -> b
te913 (Pair _ b) = b

-- ** TE 9.1.4
--
-- | Define a function which takes a Pair and swaps the order of its elements.
--
-- -> Example: Pair 1 'a' ==> Pair 'a' 1

te914 :: Pair a b -> Pair b a
te914 (Pair a b) = Pair b a

-- ** TE 9.1.5
--
-- | Define a function which takes a list of Pairs and two functions. The function should
-- apply the first function to the first element of all the pairs, and apply the second one
-- to all the second elements.
--
-- -> Example: [Pair 1 'a', Pair 4 'c'] inc toupper ==> [Pair 2 'A', Pair 5 'C']

te915 :: [Pair a b] -> (a -> a) -> (b -> b) -> [Pair a b]
te915 ps f1 f2 = map (te915' f1 f2) ps
    where te915' f1 f2 (Pair a b) = Pair (f1 a) (f2 b)


{- * 9.2 Maybe Type  -}

-- ** TE 9.2.1
--
-- | Define a function that takes a Maybe data type and returns its value if it exists and a default
-- value otherwise.
--
-- -> Example: True (Just False) ==> False
-- -> Example: True Nothing      ==> True
-- -> Example: 0 Nothing         ==> 0

te921 :: a -> Maybe a -> a
te921 def Nothing  = def
te921 def (Just t) = t

-- ** TE 9.2.2
--
-- | Define a function that determines if a student has solved all of his Training Exercises.
-- The function will get a list of results as input and should return a boolean.
-- Every element in the list will represent the result of a single TE, and can be either True
-- or False, but it is also possible that the student didn't submit the TE at all.
--
-- -> Example: [Just True, Just True, Just True] ==> True
-- -> Example: [Just True, Just True, Nothing]   ==> False

--te922 :: [Maybe Bool] -> Bool
--te922 [] = True
--te922 ((Just b):bs)  = if b then te922 bs else False
--te922 ((Nothing):bs) = False

te922 :: [Maybe Bool] -> Bool
te922 = foldl step True
    where step _ (Nothing) = False
          step b (Just c)  = b && c


{- * 9.3 Fmap  -}

-- ** TE 9.3.1
--
-- | Define a function that calculates the grade for solved Training Exercises. The function
-- argument is a list of Training Exercises (Maybe Bools) where True means that the exercise
-- is solved correctly. In case that an exercise is not solved (Nothing), return Nothing.
--
-- P.S.
-- As we are really, very, extremely strict while grading Training Exercises,
-- you can assume that every training exercise that got a passing grade will be
-- graded as 5, while all the failing ones will be graded as 1.
--
-- -> Example: [Just True, Just True, Just True] ==> [Just 5, Just 5, Just 5]
-- -> Example: [Just True, Just False, Nothing]   ==> [Just 5, Just 1, Nothing]

te931 :: [Maybe Bool] -> [Maybe Int]
te931 = map $ fmap (\x -> if x then 5 else 1)


{- * 9.4 Recursive Data Structures  -}

-- ** TE 9.4.1
--
-- | Take a look at the following definition for a Tree:

data Tree a = Nil
            | Node { value :: a,
                    left  :: Tree a,
                    right :: Tree a }
  deriving Show

-- ** TE 9.4.2
--
-- | Write a function that calculates the sum of all nodes in a given Tree.
--
-- -> Example: Node 1 (Node 2 Nil Nil) (Node 4 Nil Nil) ==> 7

te942 :: Num a => Tree a -> a
te942 Nil                 = 0
te942 (Node t left right) = t + (te942 left) + (te942 right)

-- ** TE 9.4.3
--
-- | Write a function that returns the maximum node in a given Tree.
--
-- -> Example: Node 1 (Node 2 Nil Nil) (Node 4 Nil Nil) ==> Just 4

-- (>) :: Ord a => a -> a -> Bool
te943 :: Ord a => Tree a -> Maybe a
te943 Nil                 = Nothing
te943 (Node x left right) = max (Just x) $ max (te943 left) (te943 right)
