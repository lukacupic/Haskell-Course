# PUH Training: TE06

Welcome to your fifth Haskell training.

## Exercises

You should know the drill by now - solve the exercises in `TrainingExercises.hs`,
run the tests with Cabal, push to `training-06`, create a Merge Request,
and assign it to your TA.

Keep in mind that **all exposed functions must have type signatures**
(helper functions that are defined in local definitions don't)!

Unlike other exercises, some functions in this exercise don't have names like te6**.
Instead, they have 'normal' names. You will see why as you solve exercise.
Do not rename the functions.

There aren't any extra tasks - **all tasks are mandatory**.

As always, ask your TA if you need any help.
