# PUH Level 1 Battle

Welcome to your first PUH Battle!

Unlike training, you're alone here. But don't fret - if you solved all your
exercises and have a good understanding of topics covered, you should have
no problems.

This battle consists of 3 tasks. **You must successfully solve all of them in
order to win the battle.** Every task has a single function in the form of
`l1x`, e.g. for the first task you have to write a function `l11`.

The output will be tested both automatically and manually, which means you must
take care of the output formatting (spaces, punctuation etc.)

**Do not change provided type signatures!** They're here to help you. Use them
wisely.

Finally, you are allowed (encouraged, even) to **create helper functions** as
you see fit. However, every helper function **must** have type signatures
defined.

## Deadlines

The **soft deadline** is Saturday, 20 October 2018 at 12pm (noon).

The **hard deadline** is Saturday, 27 October 2018 at 12pm (noon).

If you want two takes at this battle, submit the first one (this one) before the
soft deadline.

More on this can be read [here](https://puh.takelab.fer.hr/PUH/readme/blob/master/markdown/course-organisation.md#submission-deadlines).

## How to

You can use cabal or GHCi.

To use cabal, run

```
cabal repl
```

which will run repl. To reload, type `:r`.

If that's not working for you, run

```
ghci
```

and load the Level Battle:

```
:l LevelBattle
```

## Final note

Although you are not allowed to ask for help in solving the exercises, if you
have any trouble with infrastructure, running repl, or anything similar,
**please ask for help on Slack** (but do it in public channels, e.g. `#haskell`).

# Good luck!
