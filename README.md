# PUH assignments - Luka Čupić

Welcome to your PUH assignments repository, *Beeblebrox*. Here's a quick intro to how things are gonna work around here.

## Your TA is [Leon Luttenberger](https://puh.takelab.fer.hr/leon.luttenberger)

All your assignments will be handed to you through the repository - they will
appear on the `master` branch in the pertinent directory. This repository will
contain both your training exercises and level battles.

You can find your training exercises in the `training-exercises/TExx` directory.
The level battle assignments will find their way to the `level-battles/Lx`
directory.

Your TA is registered as the repository owner because that way it's easier for
us to organise stuff. Keep in mind that you are not allowed to push to `master`
(it's a protected branch).

## The workflow

The `master` branch is where all your assignments can be found. Before you start
working on an assignment, pull the most recent `master` and create a new branch
for the assignment you are about to tackle.

Once you are done with the assignment, push its branch to the repository. Once
pushed, [create a new *Merge request*](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-merge-request.html)
for merging the assignment branch onto the `master` and **assign the Merge Request
to your TA**.

A TA (your TA in case of training, someone else in case of battles) will then
review your work and either provide you with comments, or approve the merge
request. Your assignment is approved when your branch is merged onto `master`.

### Naming guidelines

To make your TA's life easier, follow the following simple branch naming
guidelines:

* name your *training* branches `training-XX`, e.g. `training-01` for the first
training
* name your *level battle* branches `level-X`, e.g. `level-1` for the first
level battle.
